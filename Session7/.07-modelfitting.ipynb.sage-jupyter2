{"type":"cell","id":"01ee64","pos":4,"input":"## Theory\n\nProbably the most common task for an observational astronomer is fitting a model to some data. Suppose we have a model $M$ with some parameters $\\theta$. For example, our model, $M$ could be a straight line $y = mx+c$, with parameters $\\theta = (m,c)$. Model fitting is the process of finding the parameters which *best fit* our data, and the corresponding uncertainties on them. To do this, we obviously have to have some objective **measure** of how well our model fits our data. Such a measure is often called a **figure of merit**.\n\n### Figures of merit\n\n### The sum-of-the-squares\n\nSuppose we have a model $y(x)$ and we observe a set of points $(x_i,y_i)$. If our model is a good fit to the data then the model prediction at a certain data point $y(x_i)$ will lie close to the observation $y_i$. Therefore, the sum-of-the squares statistic\n\n$${\\rm SS} = \\sum_i [y_i - y(x_i)]^2,$$\n\nis a measure of how well our model fits the data. Smaller values of ${\\rm SS}$ imply a better fit. For scientific data, the sum-of-the-squares is not the best figure of merit. This is because every data point contributes equally to the sum, regardless of it's uncertainty.\n\n### The $\\chi^2$ statistic\n\nThis is the most commonly used measure of goodness-of-fit. Suppose again that we have a model $y(x)$ and we observe a set of points $(x_i,y_i)$, each with corresponding uncertainties $\\sigma_i$. The $\\chi^2$ statistic is \n\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{y_i - y(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right) ^2,$$\n\nwhere $y(x_i)$ is the prediction of our model at $x_i$. Intuitively, we can see that $\\chi^2$ measures goodness of fit. The quantity $ [y_i - y(x_i)]/\\sigma_i $ is a measure of how many error bars a data point is away from our model. We saw in the [lectures](http://slittlefair.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy241/lectures/L10/index.html#gaussian) that if our model fits well, most data points lie within 1$\\sigma$, but a third lie further away. Therefore, we'd expect $\\chi^2$ for a good fit to roughly equal the number of data points. Poor fits will yield larger versions of $\\chi^2$.  A common way to fit a model is therefore to find the model parameters which **minimise** $\\chi^2$.\n\nIf you want to prove to yourself that minimising $\\chi^2$ is not just intuitively correct, but formally correct, have a look at the companion notebook `07a-why_chisq.ipynb`.","cell_type":"markdown"}

{"type":"cell","id":"ce613a","pos":11,"input":"# Fitting models with SciPy\n\nIn this case our data looks like a straight line will fit it. If we want to fit a polynomial to some data, the easiest way is to use the ```numpy.polyfit``` package. I show how to do that in the companion notebook `07b-polynomials.ipynb`. For this lab, we are going to learn a different approach, which has the advantage that it will scale to more complex models.\n\nIf we want to fit a model which is more complex than a polynomial, we can use scipy's **optimize** library. This library has many routines for finding the parameters of a model which best fit your data. We're going to look at the [curve fit](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit) function in scipy's [optimize](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) package, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find the parameters which best fit our data.\n\n### The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm: theory\n\nFinding the model parameters which minimise $\\chi^2$ for a function requires an algorithm, or recipe. You could imagine using a brute-force method where you calculate $\\chi^2$ over a wide range of possible parameters, and find the best ones. Such a method does work, but is very slow - impractically so for models that have more than two parameters.\n\nThe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an attempt to find the best parameters more efficiently. It is a type of \"gradient-search\" method, illustrated in the figure below:\n\n<img src=\"../../images/lev-marq1.png\" style=\"margin: 20px\" width=750px/>\n\nThe plot above shows how $\\chi^2$ depends upon the model parameter for a model with a single free parameter. From a given starting point, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm finds the \"downhill\" direction in $\\chi^2$, and steps in that direction until $\\chi^2$ stops decreasing. This location gives the parameter values which minimise $\\chi^2$. The steps taken are shown by the red dots and solid red line. The idea is easily extended to models with more than one free parameter (for example, a straight line fit has two - the slope and the gradient):\n\n<img src=\"../../images/lev-marq.png\" style=\"margin: 20px\"/>\n\nThe greyscale in the image above shows the $\\chi^2$ space for a model with two parameters, $a$ and $b$. Dark areas represent low values of $\\chi^2$, blue contours show lines of constant $\\chi^2$. From a given starting point, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm follows the \"downhill\" direction in $\\chi^2$, and steps in that direction until $\\chi^2$ stops decreasing. This location gives the parameter values which minimise $\\chi^2$. The steps taken are shown by the red dots and solid red line.\n\nThis second figure also illustrates an important point about model-fitting: there can be more than one \"valley\" of low $\\chi^2$ in the parameter space, and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm always sets off in the local downhill direction until the minimum is reached. This can lead to the function finding a local $\\chi^2$ minimum, which is not the *global* $\\chi^2$ minimum, as illustrated by the dashed red line.\n\nWhat this means for you in practice is that the \"best-fit\" you find for a model **may not be the overall best fit**, and will depend upon your starting position. It is **always** good practice when fitting a model to data to check that starting from different positions gives the same solution.\n\n### The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm: practice\n\nSuppose we want to fit a model (any model) to some data. The first step is to write **a function that calculates the prediction of our model** at some location, $x$. The first argument of this function should be the location $x$. The remaining arguments are our model parameters. Therefore, for a straight line, our function looks like this (as always, read the documentation string carefully to understand how the function works):","cell_type":"markdown"}
