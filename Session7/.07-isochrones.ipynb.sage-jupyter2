{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a946cc","input":"# Distance, extinction and reddening\n\nIf you've done the last step correctly, you should find the isochrone lies nowhere near your data. What's going on?\n\nThe answer is that your data are in **apparent** magnitudes, **and** the light from the stars has been extincted and reddened by dust lying between us and the cluster. The `isochrones` library returns **absolute**, unreddened magnitudes.\n\nThe conversion between absolute and apparent magnitudes depends upon the distance to the cluster:\n\n$$m - M = 5 \\log_{10} (d/10),$$\n\nwhere $d$ is the distance in parsecs. Notice that this will affect the magnitudes, but not the colour! This means the effect of distance is to move the isochrone vertically on the CMD.\n\nWhat about reddening and extinction? Just like extinction by dust in our own atmosphere, interstellar extinction will make the stars fainter, and redder. So, whilst a finite distance moves an star vertically in the CMD, dust along the line of sight will move a star down and to the right.\n\nWe can write that the total extinction in the $V$-band, in magnitudes, is $A_V$. This means that if the true magnitude of a star is $V_0$, the observed magnitude is $V = V_0 + A_V$. However, the dust also makes the star redder, so we can write that the true colour of the star is related to the observed colour is $(B-V) = (B-V)_0 + E(B-V)$. The quantity $E(B-V)$ is known as the colour excess, or reddening.\n\nSince both $A_V$ and $E(B-V)$ are related to the amount of dust between us and the cluster, it should not surprise you that they are related. It turns out that $A_V = 3.1 E(B-V)$; see [Shultz & Wiemer (1975)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975A%26A....43..133S/abstract), for example.","pos":24,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ac2014","input":"## Uncertainties\n\nHow to judge our uncertainties in the three quantities? One way is to try out isochrones of different ages. Suppose we try an isochrone which is 200 Myr older than our best fit above. We'd need to change the distance and extinction again to get it as close as possible to the data, but once we'd done that, it might still be a \"reasonable\" fit; i.e it looks OK by-eye. \n\nWhat if we tried one 400 Myr older? Perhaps, even after tweaking the distance and reddening, we still had a poor fit to the data, again judged by-eye. In this case, we'd conclude that a cluster 200 Myr older was consistent with our data, but one 400 Myr older is not. Therefore, an uncertainty of 200 Myr on the age would seem reasonable.\n\nWe could use the spreads in distance and extinction we found to estimate uncertainties in those properties, too.\n\n<section class=\"challenge panel panel-success\"> \n<div class=\"panel-heading\">\n<h2><span class=\"fa fa-question\"></span>  Q2: Finding our errors (4 points)</h2>\n</div>\n</section>\n\n> Use the approach above to find error bars for your age, distance and extinction to the cluster.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0f10a","input":"## The `isochrones` library\n\nThe `isochrones` library is not built into Python, but it is installed on the Python3 (System-Wide) kernel on CoCalc. If you are running on your own laptop, you will have to install it yourself (`pip install isochrones`). The `isochrones` library allows you to compute the location in a colour-magnitude diagram of a co-eval population of stars, based on pre-computed grids of evolutionary stellar models.\n\nYou can use several sets of stellar models with the library, but we will use the so-called \"MIST\" stellar models, detailed in [Choi et al 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...823..102C/abstract).\n\nYou can import the MIST Isochrones using the following code:","pos":13,"type":"cell"}

Follow the instructions below to find the age, distance and reddening to your cluster, with errors.\n\nBy trial and error, using the functions written above, you can alter the distance, reddening and age until the isochrone sequence lines up with the data.\n\nHowever, if you **only fit the position of the main-sequence stars**, you could do this for an isochrone of **any** age! Even if the isochrone is the wrong age there will be a value of the reddening and distance which will make the main sequence of the isochrone line up with the main sequence in the data. How then do we find the age of the cluster?\n\nThe answer is that only an isochrone of the correct age will simultaneously fit the main sequence, the location of the M-S turn-off and the location of giant stars in your cluster. If you've chosen the right age, the location of stars in various evolutionary stages will line up with the isochrone - if you have the right distance and reddening.\n\nYou might want to read the companion notebook `understanding_CMDs.ipynb`, which helps explain where stars at various stages of evolution appear in the CMD.\n\nTo put all this together, you can imagine finding the age, distance and reddening all from one colour magnitude diagram. You would follow a process something like this:\n\n1. Pick an age. \n2. Adjust the distance and reddening until the isochrone lies near the data. \n3. Try a slightly younger, or older age and repeat step 2.\n4. If the fit has got worse, try changing the age in the other direction.\n\nWhen you find the right age, distance and redenning, the isochrone should match up with the data!\n\n<section class=\"challenge panel panel-success\"> \n<div class=\"panel-heading\">\n<h2><span class=\"fa fa-question\"></span>  Q1: Find the best fitting isochrone (4 points)</h2>\n</div>\n</section>\n\n> Using the method above, find the distance, reddening and age that best fits your cluster.
